# Plat14

I started working on this project in order to help people in my NGO work and organise better in a team.
Features:
- log-in system with a database of users and password encrypting
- option to join a team by code or create a new team
- option to create projects within a team, edit them & manage responsible members
- option to add reminders, issues & other details to the projects 
- option to personalize the account with a wide range of avatar pictures

The application is optimised to refresh in real-time the edits & modified components without having to refresh the page.

Next Steps:
- add a workspace for the team in order to simplify the work and tasks management
- add a personalized calendar which can contain information about events & projects
- add a password recovery option
- add responsiveness to the app in order to be used on mobile
- add a notifications system
